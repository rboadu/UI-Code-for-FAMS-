            <h2> Our Mission: </h2>
            <p>
                The primary goal is to develop interactive robotic
                systems for industrial and educational applications. 
                The main focuses are surgical, after-surgical rehabilitation, 
                and wearable devices for enhancing accessibility. 
                We also look into the educational aspect of robotic 
                systems for college and K-12 students.
